## 1. 3Sum
Given an integer array nums, return all the triplets [nums[i], nums[j], nums[k]] such that i != j, i != k, and j != k, and nums[i] + nums[j] + nums[k] == 0. 

Notice that the solution set must not contain duplicate triplets.
#### Example:
    Input: nums = [-1,0,1,2,-1,-4]
    Output: [[-1,-1,2],[-1,0,1]]

## 2. Add Two Numbers
You are given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers. The digits are stored in reverse order, and each of their nodes contains a single digit. Add the two numbers and return the sum as a linked list.

You may assume the two numbers do not contain any leading zero, except the number 0 itself.
#### Example:
    Input: l1 = [2,4,3], l2 = [5,6,4]
    Output: [7,0,8]
    Explanation: 342 + 465 = 807.

## 3. Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters
Given a string s, find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.

#### Example:
    Input: s = "abcabcbb"
    Output: 3
    Explanation: The answer is "abc", with the length of 3.
